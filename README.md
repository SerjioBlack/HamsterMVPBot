# Telegram Game Bot

This is a simple Telegram bot game where players can mine coins, attack other players, and see their status. The bot also includes some AI-controlled bot players.

## Features

- Start a game session
- Check your player's status
- Mine coins with a cooldown period
- Attack random players or bots
- Earn coins and defeat opponents

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this bot, you'll need:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.
- A Telegram bot token, which you can get by creating a bot with [BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#botfather).

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/telegram-game-bot.git
   cd telegram-game-bot
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure the bot token:**

   Replace `YOUR_BOT_TOKEN` in the code with your actual Telegram bot token.

   ```javascript
   const token = 'YOUR_BOT_TOKEN';
   ```

### Running the Bot

Once you have installed the dependencies and set the token:

```bash
node index.js
```

This will start the bot, and it will be ready to interact with users.

### Commands

- **/start** - Start the game and create a new player.
- **/help** - Show a list of available commands.
- **/status** - Check your current health and coins.
- **/mine** - Mine random coins (with a 5-second cooldown).
- **/attack** - Attack a random player or bot (with a 5-second cooldown).

### Handling Polling Errors

If you encounter any polling errors, they will be logged in the console. The bot is configured to handle these errors and will continue running.
